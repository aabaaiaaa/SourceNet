Reconnect to ClientA-Corporate network (they've re-authorized you)\n3. Use Network Scanner to find BOTH file systems:\n   - fileserver-01 (original location - currently empty)\n   - backup-server (backup location - has the files you need to copy)\n4. Open TWO File Manager windows - one for each file system\n5. Copy all log files FROM backup-server TO fileserver-01\n\nThis mission pays 1,000 credits. It won't get you out of debt, but it's a start.\n\nYou need to work until you're back in the black (not overdrawn anymore). There are several missions available after this one - all basic file work.

Network credentials provided for missions are temporary - once a job is done (successfully or not), the client's access credentials are automatically invalidated. You'll see revoked entries in your Network Address Register (NAR) for record-keeping.\n\nDon't worry about losing access. Each new mission comes with fresh credentials.

      "body": "scenario_user,\n\nWell done. You've worked hard and gotten yourself out of debt. I knew there was a reason we hired you.\n\nNow that you've proven you can handle the basics, it's time to talk about upgrading your equipment. The work you've been doing is fine, but with better hardware, you could be taking on more lucrative contracts.\n\nFirst, let me explain how hardware works. Unlike software (which you just download and install), hardware requires a system REBOOT to take effect. When you purchase hardware from the Portal, it won't be active until you reboot your terminal via the Power menu. The boot sequence will detect and initialize the new hardware.\n\nI'd recommend starting with a better NETWORK ADAPTER. Your current adapter is the bottleneck - it's limiting how fast you can transfer files. Networks you connect to have plenty of bandwidth, but your terminal can only receive data as fast as your adapter allows. A faster adapter means quicker file operations, which means more missions completed in less time.\n\nI'm also releasing access to the LOG VIEWER tool. Every network keeps records of who connects and what file operations they perform - including yours. The Log Viewer lets you pull these records from any network you're connected to. It's useful for investigating suspicious activity, understanding what other users have been doing on a system, or just reviewing your own work. Keep in mind that YOUR activity is being logged too - network administrators can see what you've been up to just as easily as you can see what others have done.\n\nCheck the Portal - Network Adapters (hardware) and Log Viewer (software) are now available for purchase.\n\nGet your hardware upgraded and the new tools installed. I'll send details on the new mission once you're ready.\n\n- Riley",
