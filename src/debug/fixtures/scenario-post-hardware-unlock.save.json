No repairing, no deleting, just copying. You can handle that, right?\n\nHere's what you need to do:\n\n1. Open the Mission Board and accept \"Log File Restoration\"\n2. Reconnect to ClientA-Corporate network (they've re-authorized you)\n3. Use Network Scanner to find BOTH file systems:\n   - fileserver-01 (original location - currently empty)\n   - backup-server (backup location - has the files you need to copy)\n4. Open TWO File Manager windows - one for each file system\n5. Copy all log files FROM backup-server TO fileserver-01\n\nThis mission pays 1,000 credits. It won't get you out of debt, but it's a start.\n\nYou need to work until you're back in the black (not overdrawn anymore). There are several missions available after this one - all basic file work. Boring stuff, but you're not in a position to be picky right now given your situation.\n\nOnce you're out of debt, I'll reach out again with better work.\n\nDon't mess this one up.\n\n- Avery",

You'll see revoked entries in your Network Address Register (NAR) for record-keeping.\n\nDon't worry about losing access. Each new mission comes with fresh credentials.

      "body": "scenario_user,\n\nWell done. You've worked hard and gotten yourself out of debt. I knew there was a reason we hired you.\n\nNow that you've proven you can handle the basics, it's time to talk about upgrading your equipment. The work you've been doing is fine, but with better hardware, you could be taking on more lucrative contracts.\n\nFirst, let me explain how hardware works. Unlike software (which you just download and install), hardware requires a system REBOOT to take effect. When you purchase hardware from the Portal, it won't be active until you reboot your terminal via the Power menu. The boot sequence will detect and initialize the new hardware.\n\nI'd recommend starting with a better NETWORK ADAPTER. Your current adapter is the bottleneck - it's limiting how fast you can transfer files. Networks you connect to have plenty of bandwidth, but your terminal can only receive data as fast as your adapter allows. A faster adapter means quicker file operations, which means more missions completed in less time.\n\nCheck the Hardware section in the Portal. Network Adapters are now available for purchase.\n\nI'm also working on getting you access to some specialized tools. There's a job coming up that requires specific software:\n\n- LOG VIEWER: A tool for retrieving and analyzing device logs. Some missions require examining connection logs, file operation history, or process logs from network devices.\n\n- DATA RECOVERY TOOL: For scanning file systems to find deleted files and restore them. Also has a secure delete function for when files need to be permanently destroyed.\n\nThese tools will be available in the Portal's Software section. You'll need them for the work I'm lining up.\n\nGet your hardware upgraded and the new tools installed. I'll send details on the new mission once you're ready.\n\n- Avery",
