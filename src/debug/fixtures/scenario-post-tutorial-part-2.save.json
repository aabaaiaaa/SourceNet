Reconnect to ClientA-Corporate network (they've re-authorized you)\n3. Use Network Scanner to find BOTH file systems:\n   - fileserver-01 (original location - currently empty)\n   - backup-server (backup location - has the files you need to copy)\n4. Open TWO File Manager windows - one for each file system\n5. Copy all log files FROM backup-server TO fileserver-01\n\nThis mission pays 1,000 credits. It won't get you out of debt, but it's a start.\n\nYou need to work until you're back in the black (not overdrawn anymore). There are several missions available after this one - all basic file work. Boring stuff, but you're not in a position to be picky right now given your situation.\n\nOnce you're out of debt, I'll reach out again with better work.\n\nDon't mess this one up.\n\n- Reese",
