Use Network Scanner to find BOTH file systems:\n   - fileserver-01 (original location - currently empty)\n   - backup-server (backup location - has the files you need to copy)\n4. Open TWO File Manager windows - one for each file system\n5. Copy all log files FROM backup-server TO fileserver-01\n\nThis mission pays 1,000 credits. It won't get you out of debt, but it's a start.\n\nYou need to work until you're back in the black (not overdrawn anymore). There are several missions available after this one - all basic file work.

You'll see revoked entries in your Network Address Register (NAR) for record-keeping.\n\nDon't worry about losing access. Each new mission comes with fresh credentials.

      "body": "scenario_user,\n\nWell done. You've worked hard and gotten yourself out of debt. I knew there was a reason we hired you.\n\nNow that you've proven you can handle the basics, it's time to talk about upgrading your equipment. The work you've been doing is fine, but with better hardware, you could be taking on more lucrative contracts.\n\nFirst, let me explain how hardware works. Unlike software (which you just download and install), hardware requires a system REBOOT to take effect. When you purchase hardware from the Portal, it won't be active until you reboot your terminal via the Power menu. The boot sequence will detect and initialize the new hardware.\n\nI'd recommend starting with a better NETWORK ADAPTER. Your current adapter is the bottleneck - it's limiting how fast you can transfer files. Networks you connect to have plenty of bandwidth, but your terminal can only receive data as fast as your adapter allows. A faster adapter means quicker file operations, which means more missions completed in less time.\n\nI'm also releasing access to the LOG VIEWER and DATA RECOVERY TOOL.\n\nThe Log Viewer lets you pull network records from any network you're connected to. It's useful for investigating suspicious activity, understanding what other users have been doing on a system, or reviewing your own work.\n\nThe Data Recovery Tool lets you scan file systems for deleted files and restore them. You can also securely delete files - useful when you need to ensure sensitive data is truly gone and cannot be recovered by anyone.\n\nKeep in mind that YOUR activity is being logged too - network administrators can see what you've been up to just as easily as you can see what others have done.\n\nCheck the Portal - Network Adapters (hardware), Log Viewer and Data Recovery Tool (software) are now available for purchase.\n\nOnce you have BOTH the Log Viewer AND the Data Recovery Tool installed, I'll reach out with details on investigative work that requires these tools.\n\n- Casey",

That means you're ready for investigative work.\n\nThese contracts are different from basic file operations. Clients come to us when something's gone wrong - data's been deleted, someone's been messing with their systems, or they need to track down what happened. Your job is to figure out what occurred and fix it.\n\nThe tools you just installed are essential:\n- Log Viewer: Shows you who did what on a network. Every file access, every deletion, every connection - it's all logged.\n- Data Recovery Tool: Deleted files aren't truly gone until someone overwrites them. You can scan for and restore files that were \"deleted\" but not securely wiped.\n\nI've got your first investigation lined up. A local library had some files go missing from their archives. They suspect an intern, but they need proof and they need the files back.\n\nCheck the Mission Board - the contract should be available now.\n\n- Casey",
