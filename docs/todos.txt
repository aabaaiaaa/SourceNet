TODOs

(wip - testing)
Once the tutorial part 2 mission is completed, there should be other missions then made available (they should be similar beginner missions). There should be some mission types already created in the phase 2 spec, or some will need to be created. At least there should be missions like the tutorial missions where you need to repair files or copy files or delete files.
There are some mission data files already, but they aren't being used at the moment. I would like to start making some post tutorial missions available once you complete the tutorial part 2 mission, so the mission board does has some missions available. I would like to see what types of missions can be created based on the software that is currently available.
There are some missions suggested in the phase 2 docs that require more than the software already available and they will need to be skipped for this initial change. However, there's a lot of variation that could be used to create unique missions that use copy/delete/repair files and different filesystems as well as file sytems across different networks too. So the idea would be to create missions that feel more involved than just copy from a to b location. Also, the narrative of these missions matter so coming up with believable narratives is important - I'm happy for you to embelish stories for each.
Ideally I'm looking for around 7 unique missions for now.
The plan is to have some missions that require a better reputation so the player cannot access those until they've worked a bit to repair their rep after the tutorial missions.
-- (WIP!!!!!) - WORKING ON THIS NOW
need to create a new generated scenario - Prior to tutorial part 2 verify mission completion objective - so that another e2e test can load this scenario up and that last objective can be completed automatically and then trigger the post tutorial game state (that the generated missions load up in the mission board).
This game state will need to be saved immediately after the 2nd from last mission objective is completed as the last mission objective "verify mission completion" is a timed event and is only a short time.
Then a new e2e test can be created to test the error above and iterate on this without needing to go through the whole tutorial missions over and over.

(WIP - missions are better but have objectives like copy files, but not to paste them anywhere, which doesn't make sense - it should be to copy them to a location, not just copy them)
the mission generator system is not fit for purpose because it generates missions that have unsupported objectives. there are core building blocks of apps and systems like the message system and scripted event system that could be used to create varying sized missions with different narratives based on all the client/back story.
I need you to review the mission generator and plan out changes that allow actual compatible objectives to be created that make sense.
You'll need to review network structures, what devices can be seen and how apps interact with those networks.
VPN client allows connecting to multiple netowkrs as well as disconnecting.
Netowrk scanner discovers devices on a network.
File Manager allows file systems that have been discovered to have their files listed (if there are any files). It also allows file operations like copy, delete and repair be done (repair on corrupted files only).
THe NAR app allows you to see all entries you have access to as well as ones you've gotten revoked from. It also has a connect/disconnect function that links through to the VPN client.
NAR entries are always shared through a message as an attachment.
NAR entries can be revoked at the end of missions too.
There's no limit to the number of NAR entry attachments a mission might need, as each NAR entry gives you access to at least 1 network of devices.
The file manager has the ability to have multiple instances open so a player can copy from one network and paste into another (if they had previously connected to 2 separate networks).
Missions could have time based objectives (needs to be completed by a time else fail. And missions in the mission board should have expiration dates.
All missions MUST have a "verify mission completion" objective that is added to the end of all other objectives. This serves as a cooldown so the player can see that once the last real mission objective is complete, there's time for them to see the completion happen. But this delay also serves as a way to extend missions by adding in an additional objective to the mission.
As an example of a basic mission structure:
1. message from the client of the mission with some mission narrative and the NAR entry in order to access their network. One NAR entry as a minimum but they could provide multiple NAR entries for multiple networks.
2. VPN client is used to connect to the network or networks.
3. network scanner discovers devices.
4. File manager can be used to access file systems and manipulate files using copy/paste/delete/repair. The actions required should be based on the narrative of the mission.
5. There could be any number of networks/devices that make up the mission and therefore have multiple levels of objectives that need fulfilling.
6. Once all mission objectives completed, it's just the "verify mission completion" objective that will auto-complete IF there's no scripted event that happens.
7. Scripted events can trigger on any event or after a particular objective, so for example a message from the client could be sent with additional mission information or NAR entries for new devices that need interacting with.
8. Message from client with the payout for the mission.
You can look at the tutorial parts 1 + 2 for some examples, but this is not the limit.

mission extensions

(wip - needs testing)
missions are mostly to do with copy/delete/repair of files at the moment. But the objectives are often about operating on all the files that are present on a file system, instead of being only some of the files and having to check which files should be operated out of all the files.
also, there should be more variation on the number of file systems that are generated. There's no limit to the number of file systems that could exist - for example back up mission might be backing up from multiple locations/networks to a central location.
the file types and names and sizes need to vary more. epsecially with backup missions as would might expect very large files for backup missions. also for repair missions, there might be large DB files that need repairing AND then a backup taken.
There could be backup missions where you restore from the backup, but need to delete the corrupt files first and then restore from the backup.

(done - needs testing)
If i've already scanned and discovered a particular file system, the objective tracker should mark the objective as completed, even if I scanned it BEFORE I reached that objective - it shouldn't matter the order you completed objectives.
---
(done - needs testing)
Some objectives require files to be copied from multiple locations and then pasted into a central location - because the way you copy (and real life copy functionality) only allows you to copy one selection of files, it's pointless to have objectives where you are asked to copy files from one location and a second location and then paste all in a third location.
However, if the SSD drive on your terminal was accessible through the File Manager app too, then one of the options on the drop down for it would be your local machine, so then the player could copy and paste the files from multiple locations to your local machine and then copy them all to perform the final pasting of all files. Obviously, this special file system location should not have the same slow restrictions as remote locations would as you are accessing the files locally, so copying shouldn't take long at all. Deleting and repairing local files should still take time based on the file sizes, but should be much quicker than performing those operations remotely.
Any files copied into your SSD must persist regardless of disconnection or NAR entry revocation - they should be accessible when not connected to any network - so this might need a change to the way the File Manager handles it's UI.



Review the systems in place for handling missions and scripted events and objective tracking as I need to understand how to picture these systems and how best they should integrate with each other as the biggest issues have come from changes in these areas. Each system needs to have a role and individual responsibility so there's not internal variables being changed by external systems. It will then aid in writing test cases for each system.


if any of the sessionStorage usages actaully required now? I thought they were just to attempt to fix a bug and turns out they were not critical to fixing it?


minimising the file manager and network scanner apps seems to reset some state in them so when you open them back up, the dropdowns are not selected anymore. It might not be just the dropdowns that are affected, but ideally no visuals should be affected once you open the app back up from minimising.


(WIP)
When the sabotage event happens and files are deleted, it should be deleting the log files that the player just repaired! Currently it's just adding log entries for non-existent files it's deleting.


(done)
The File Manager shows filesystems on the network even before the network scanner has scanned the network to discover those devices. The point of the network scanner is to discover devices on the network - in this tutorial mission, you are being shown that more devices can be discovered over time.


(done)
The Network Scanner is still showing "disconnected from network" even once you reconnect to the network.


(done)
At the end of the tutorial part 2 mission, when you are disconnected because you've finished the mission, the connection popup is showing 2 entries for disconnection (the message "Disconnecting from ClientA-Corporate due to access revocation" shows twice in the console).


(done - needs testing)
Just like how pasting clears the clipboard, if you disconnect from the network that contains the files you've copied, the clipboard should also clear for those files that are copied for that same network. Currently the clipboard doesn't appear to clear on disconnection as when you reconnect, they are still in the clipboard. Obviously, if you disconnect from a differet network that is not related to the files, then the clipboard shouldn't clear those files. But given you can only copy one series of files from the same location, if the first is from the disconnected network, then all would be.


(done - needs testing)
In the File Manager, if you paste in some files then switch to another file system in the same instance of the File Manager, if you were to switch back to the original file system, you do not see the files that you pasted in. When manipulating files in File Manager, they should stay that way. I understand that for the particular case of the tutorial missions when you are revisiting the same network that the 2nd NAR entry you receive will change the network based on what is set in the mission data, but you could write that down to the network having whatever you did previous undone.
The persistance of these changes to files I would expect to persist between a disconnect and reconnecting as long as the NAR entry you are using is the same one (hasn't been revoked/deauthed).
