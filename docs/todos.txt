TODOs

(done - needs trying)
The Network Address Register app should show that any NAR entry that is not autorised now is not authorised (revoked access).


(done - needs manual testing)
Plan - I want NAR entries for missions to be revoked at the end of the missions (so to not pollute the NAR app once you've completed 50+ missions). Though there might be some networks eventually that you have prolonged access to, for now there will not be. I need to see which is best, the mission to have mission data set that tells the game code that a particular NAR entry should have it's access revoked, or if that setting should be linked to the NAR entry itself.


(done - needs trying)
For the tutorial mission part 2 (the end of the tutorial), the manager should also send a message about how NAR entries are likely to be automatically revoked once a mission completes (successfully or not).


(done - needs trying)
The tutorial part 1 mission should have an initial objective of adding the NAR entry from message attachment, so to help users know that's vital to the mission and to point them in the right direction. There should be an event that is triggered for accepting NAR entries or attachments already.


(done - needs trying)
Instead of payment being autmatically applied on mission completion, a templated message from the client of the mission with a digital cheque to that value. Reputation should still be applied on mission completion as that's linked who you are working for at the time (SourceNet).


(think this is already done?)
When saving game state and reloading, it seems that the active connections are still connected. If it's easier to force the user to manually disconnect from any networks before they are allowed to save, then that should be the change, but the save button should not be enabled and a tooltip should tell them why they cannot save yet.


(done - needs testing)
The network scanner progress bar animation needs to use in game time to function so the user speeding up the game will also speed up the scanning.


(done - needs testing)
When loading up a save game, there are duplicate messages being delivered that should only come through when you start a new game (the 2 welcome messages). I can see they are being gated and not showing in game, but the issue is really that they are attempting to fire at all. It might highlight a core game issue. I understand that there might be a trigger for them that is an amount of time once you load up the desktop, but it might just be that they are using a badly chosen trigger.


(done - needs testing)
When using the sleep function to return to the game login screen, I can still see activity happening for the game I just left - I heard chimes for notifications and can see console output of events.


(done - needs testing)
What is happening now is the cleared game timers have cleared critical events that then don't attempt to fire when you load up a game that was saved mid way through a timer. For example, the "first mission" message from the manager is delivered 20 seconds after you read your manager welcome message.


(done - needs testing)
does this save and loading e2e test suite give enough test coverage for the saving and loading system?


(done - needs testing)
the banking system was updated to save which messages have been sent as the player passes warning thresholds for negative credit, but the same needs to happen for reputation as there are messages sent for bad reputation - specifically to do with the timers being saved and loaded to make sure the player doesn't miss out on any warning messages.


(done - needs testing)
In File Manager app, the repair progress bar doesn't show any progress being made, it just shows 0% and an emtpy bar. If the process is happening so quickly there's no progress bar render, then the process (all File Manager operations) might need to be artificially extended for game play purposes.


(check this...)
The message that comes through for the 2nd part of the tutorial mission should show that the NAR entry attachment can re-authorise your existing NAR enty - currently it says "Added to NAR", which is true, but because the NAR entry is now deauthorised, it's not a NAR entry you can use.


(done - needs testing)
NAR app has a connect button but it just runs an alert saying it's not implemented. Really this connect button should open the VPN client and make a connection through to that network. Obvisouly if you are already connected to that netowrk, the NAR app should show this and give you a disconnect option.


(done)
The Network Scanner can still be used without a valid network being selected. Really you should have no options other than to select a network before you can do anything else in the app. Also, if you were to get disconnected from the network it was using, that should behave in the same limiting way.



(done)
When using the sleep function, it will say that it will disconnect you from all connections, but it doesn't. So when loading that save back up, I'm still connected to the networks still.


(done - needs testing)
Not happy there's a tutorial-software-licenses-alt and tutorial-software-licenses events in mission board intro. Ideally there can just be multiple triggers required and for this example the triggers are that BOTH the message msg-mission-board-license has been read AND the mission-board software has been installed. The reason there's two events with different triggers, is that the player could already have installed the mission board BEFORE receiving the msg-mission-board-license message.
It's important that triggers can have multiple conditions so that more complex story telling can happen later in the game.


Once the tutorial part 2 mission is completed, there should be other missions then made available (they should be similar beginner missions). There should be some mission types already created in the phase 2 spec, or some will need to be created. At least there should be missions like the tutorial missions where you need to repair files or copy files or delete files.


Review the systems in place for handling missions and scripted events and objective tracking as I need to understand how to picture these systems and how best they should integrate with each other as the biggest issues have come from changes in these areas. Each system needs to have a role and individual responsibility so there's not internal variables being changed by external systems. It will then aid in writing test cases for each system.


When repairing corrupt files, once they have been repaired, relisting the files should also show the files have been repaired - currently they are showing as corrupt again - maybe the data that drives this is not being updated?


(?)
VPN client should show networks that are not authorised anymore (if the NAR entry is kept after deauth)


the sabotage event is not very obvious to the user (I have manually tested) - the deleting process happens so fast that the user cannot actually see what has happened. It could be that the File Manager app also has a log at the bottom listing all operations performed. We need enough time for the user to think, "oh what is happening, that's not me doing that". Then the administrator disconnecting you should appear more dramatic, like a red warning popup that tells you the details of the network you are being forceibly disconnected from and by the network administrator - maybe also a description of the reason (that being deleting critical files), and that it's a popup that the user has to acknowledge by clicking a dismiss button.
